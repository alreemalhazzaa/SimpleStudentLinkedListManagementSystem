# Student Linked List Management System
## Description

This project implements a Singly Linked List in C++ to manage a list of student names. It demonstrates fundamental data structure concepts, including dynamic memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and class-based encapsulation.
## Features

    Dynamic Insertion: Add students at the beginning, end (append), or at a specific numerical position in the list.

    Error Handling: The addafter function validates if the specified position exists before attempting to insert.

    List Management: Functions to display all students and count the total number of entries.

    Deletion: Remove a specific student by name with "not found" feedback if the student isn't in the list.

    Memory Management: A destructor is included to properly deallocate memory when the list object is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.


## Sample Output

Based on the project requirements, the system produces the following output:

    Validation errors for invalid insertion positions.

    The current list of student names.

    A count of the total students.

    Updates after a successful or failed deletion.
